Just a simple bot that praises people for using the correct method of marking spoilers on Reddit.

To combat spam I have added a way for users to opt out of replies.
I have also made it so that the bot would only send a single spoiler praise message per thread, this should reduce spam in spoiler heavy threads.

# Commands

Commands can be sent through a PM or a reply to the bot (Unless otherwise specified.)

    !optout - The bot will ignore your future messages that contain spoiler tags.
    !optin - The bot will stop ignoring you.
    !subout - If you are a moderator of a subreddit, use this command followed by the name of your subreddit without the 'r/' to stop the bot from checking your subreddit (Command is to be sent through modmail, a ban will also add your sub to the ignore list).
    !subin - Does the opposite of above, requires subreddit name as an argument.
